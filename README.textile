h1. Flag Show - Country Flags in your Rails App

Use this plugin (Gem whatever it becomes) to show a country's flag in your views.

It will probably be a helper you pass a country too and flag_show will then stick the flag and country initials beside it.

First we'll put the flags into the public/images directory using the rake task: rake flag_show:move_flags

Lastly, i've got no f'n clue right now how to make a rails engine only show a helper without an accompanying controller...so:

In your application_helper.rb type
    include FlagShowHelper #Just below line one or the ApplicationHelper module call.

Enjoy.  More to come, that's good enough for tonight.
