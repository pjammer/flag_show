h1. Flag Show - Country Flags in your Rails App

Use this plugin (Gem whatever it becomes) to show a country's flag in your views.

It will probably be a helper you pass a country too and flag_show will then stick the flag and country initials beside it.

First we'll put the flags into the public/images directory using the rake task: rake flag_show:move_flags
